What is it?
===========

P-Store is a simple read-optimized database system. The command line tool 
"pstore" implements two commands: "import" and "cat". The former can be used to
convert a CSV file into a P-Store database and the latter can be used to
examine contents of the database.

The design of this system is loosely based on C-Store [1] which is another Open
Source read-optimized database. The main idea is to store tabular data in
column-order to improve read performance for special purpose workloads.

P-Store is in very early stages so don't expect a whole lot from it.

How can I try it out?
=====================

The first step is to create a database file. You can import a CSV file into a
P-Store database with the following command:

  $ pstore import dataset.csv dataset.out

After that, you can use the "pstore cat" command to look into the imported
database:

  $ pstore cat dataset.out
